## Data Collection

#### Gather Running Processes
<blockquote>Run in PowerShell</blockquote>

```powershell
Get-CimInstance Win32_Process | ForEach-Object {
    $p = $_
    $parent = Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessId = $($p.ParentProcessId)"
    $grandparent = if ($parent) { 
        Get-CimInstance Win32_Process -Filter "ProcessId = $($parent.ParentProcessId)" 
    } else { 
        $null 
    }
    
    [PSCustomObject]@{
        Name = $p.Name
        HandleCount = $p.HandleCount
        ProcessId = $p.ProcessId
        ParentProcessId = $p.ParentProcessId
        ParentName = if ($parent) { $parent.Name } else { $null }
        ParentCommandLine = if ($parent) { $parent.CommandLine } else { $null }
        GrandparentName = if ($grandparent) { $grandparent.Name } else { $null }
        GrandparentCommandLine = if ($grandparent) { $grandparent.CommandLine } else { $null }
        ExecutablePath = $p.ExecutablePath
        CommandLine = $p.CommandLine
        CreationDate = $p.CreationDate
    }
} | Export-Csv -Path "ProcessDetails.csv" -NoTypeInformation
```

```

#### Document
- External IPs
- Beaconing/C2 behavior
- Unusual ports
---
### Gather Newly Written Files
<blockquote>Adjust timeframe</blockquote>

```powershell
Get-ChildItem "$env:TEMP" -Recurse | Where-Object { $_.LastWriteTime -gt (Get-Date).AddMinutes(-10) }
```

#### Document

- New DLLs
- New .tmp files
- Unrecognized, random, or suspicious file names or file paths
- Payload staging behavior
- Persistence artifacts
---
### Gather Memory Dump
<blockquote> If you have access to the internet. Run PowerShell as administrator.</blockquote>

- Download winpmem from https://github.com/Velocidex/WinPmem/releases
- cd to directory and run

```powershell
.\winpmem_mini_x64_rc2.exe <filename>.raw
```

#### Document
- Running processes from an unexpected location
- Ports that have all the same numbers such as â€˜4444â€™ or increment such as â€˜1234â€™
- [Check out this resource from SANS](https://sansorg.egnyte.com/dl/WFdH1hHnQI)
---
### Gather Loaded DLLs
<blockquote> </blockquote>

```powershell
# Create an output file
$outputFile = "C:\IR_Artifacts\LoadedDLLs.csv"
New-Item -ItemType Directory -Path "C:\IR_Artifacts" -Force | Out-Null

# Collect loaded DLLs for all running processes
Get-Process | ForEach-Object {
    $proc = $_
    try {
        $proc.Modules | ForEach-Object {
            [PSCustomObject]@{
                ProcessName = $proc.ProcessName
                ProcessId = $proc.Id
                DLLName = $_.ModuleName
                DLLPath = $_.FileName
            }
        }
    } catch {
        # Some system processes may not allow access to modules
        [PSCustomObject]@{
            ProcessName = $proc.ProcessName
            ProcessId = $proc.Id
            DLLName = "Access Denied"
            DLLPath = "Access Denied"
        }
    }
} | Export-Csv -Path $outputFile -NoTypeInformation

Write-Host "DLL collection complete. Output saved to $outputFile"
```
#### Document
- Suspicious DLL behaviors

| Artifact                                                    | Why Itâ€™s Suspicious                                                |
|-------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `OneDrive.exe` not in `C:\Program Files\OneDrive\`       | Likely copied to evade application control or logs                  |
| `crypt32.dll` next to it, not in `System32`                 | Likely sideloaded malware                                           |
| `crypt32.dll` is unsigned or unknown                        | Legit `crypt32.dll` is always signed by Microsoft                   |
| DLLs loaded from unexpected locations (e.g., AppData, Temp) | Malware often stores and loads payloads from user-writeable folders |
| Unmapped memory regions                                     | May indicate code injection or hollowing via reflective loading     |
| Suspicious processes with large numbers of DLLs or injected threads | May suggest injection, unpacking, or in-memory evasion techniques  |

- Hash the EXE and DLL â€“ are they legit?
- Check the digital signature â€“ use Get-AuthenticodeSignature
- Look at compile timestamps â€“ DLL newer than EXE = highly suspicious
- Look for C2 connection with the process

## Compile Analysis

| Artifact                  | Significance in Analysis                                                        | What to Do with It                                                   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Hash**                  | Unique fingerprint of a file; helps identify reuse across campaigns             | Look up on VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis, internal threat intel feeds   |
| **Reputation**            | Reflects known history (malicious, suspicious, clean)                           | Check EDR/AV verdicts, community tags, and threat intel platforms     |
| **Publisher/Author**      | Validates source; unknown or mismatched authors may indicate tampering          | Verify digital signatures with `Get-AuthenticodeSignature`           |
| **Behavior**              | Reveals what the file or domain does (e.g., downloads, injects, steals)         | Analyze in sandbox or memory, observe network/file/registry actions  |
| **Domains**               | Used for C2, phishing, payload delivery, tracking                               | Extract and check against DNS logs, blocklists, URL reputation tools |
| **Registrar**             | May hint at throwaway or abused services used by threat actors                  | Investigate WHOIS, registration date, privacy masking                 |
| **Owner**                 | Can tie infrastructure to known actor or service                                | Use WHOIS and hosting info to profile attacker                       |
| **IP**                    | Network pivot point; used to map attacker infra and behavior                    | Geolocate, run passive DNS, block or monitor                         |
| **Multistage / Redirect** | Indicates payload staging or evasion attempts                                   | Trace redirect chain in browser or sandbox                           |
| **IOCs on the site**      | Source of additional observables (e.g., hashes, URLs, scripts)                  | Scrape for secondary IOCs and generate detections                    |
| **Injecting malicious JS**| Sign of credential theft or browser exploitation                                | Deobfuscate scripts and look for exfil or phishing functionality     |
| **Custom Page (Phishing)**| Typically clones legit sites for stealing credentials                          | Capture screenshots, compare with real site, flag lookalike domains  |
| **Geolocation**           | Aids in attribution and policy-based risk assessment                            | Consider blocking, reporting, or tracking based on region            |
| **Other domains on IP**   | Suggests shared hosting, reuse, or infrastructure clustering                    | Use passive DNS or OSINT to identify related domains and threats     |

- Botnet/Remote Access
- Adware/PUP
- Dropper/Loader
- Fileless Malware

</details>

### Is it a Ransomware?
As time is VERY sensitive in the case of a Ransomware:  
- Follow communication protocol in Incident Response Plan
- Activate the entire SOC team
- Go to the Ransomware Workflow (coming soon).

### Is it an InfoStealer/Credential Harvester?
- Go to the Credential Theft/InfoStealer Workflow (coming soon).

### Is it Botnet/Remote Access activity?
- Go to the Botnet/Remote Access Workflow (coming soon).

### Is it Adware/PUP/Unapproved Software?
- Go to the Unapproved Software Workflow (coming soon).

### Is it a Loader/Dropper?
- Go to the Loader/Dropper Workflow (coming soon).

### Is it Fileless Malware?
- Go to the Fileless Malware Workflow (coming soon).
  
### Triage 
<details open>
<summary>Expand/Collapse</summary>

Determine
- Impact
    - Of destruction caused by malware
    - Lateral movement
    - Financial 
    - Disruption of services, workstations, operations
    - Data loss
    - Data exposure
- Scope: Number and list of hosts that
    - Have malicious files
        - Hash
        - File name
        - RegEx match (ie: INVOICE-12345.docx where `12345` is 5 random digit)
    - Attempted to connect to
        - URLs
        - IP
        - Ports
    - That have persistence mechanisms
    - Any other IOCs found

### Is it a False Positive?

If it's a False Positive:  
- Document and close the incident

If it's a True Positive:  
- Send communication to
    - Security Team
    - Admin Teams
    - Affected asset owners
    - Affected users
    - Managers, etc. according to Incident Response Plan
- Go to Analyze phase
