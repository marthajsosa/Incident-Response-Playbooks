# Incident Response Playbooks

Welcome to my collection of **Incident Response (IR) Playbooks**. These resources are designed to guide analysts, responders, and security teams through structured, tactical response processes for a variety of cybersecurity incidents. Each playbook outlines detection methods, investigation steps, containment strategies, and recovery procedures‚Äîgrounded in real-world response workflows.

## About These Playbooks

This repository is a living, evolving set of playbooks based on best practices, threat intelligence, created from my academic and hands-on experience in security operations and incident response. Each playbook is written in a clear, concise, and procedural style to support quick decision-making and consistent handoff between analysts.

## üîç Incident Types Covered

Playbooks will be added for a wide range of scenarios, including but not limited to:

- [Malware Infections](https://github.com/marthajsosa/Incident-Response-Playbooks/tree/main/IR%20Malware)
- **Phishing Attacks** (coming soon)
- **Data Loss or Exfiltration** (coming soon)
- **Ransomware Events** (coming soon)
- **Critical Infrastructure Compromise** (coming soon)
- **Account Compromise** (coming soon)
- **Insider Threats** (coming soon)
- **Unusual Administrative Behavior** (coming soon)
- **Suspicious File or Process Execution** (coming soon)

## üß≠ Playbook Structure

Each playbook follows a consistent format as suggested by NIST 800-61 to support repeatable workflows:

- **Preparation**
- **Detection & Analysis**
- **Containment**
- **Eradication**
- **Recovery**
- **Post-Incident Activity**

## üéØ Goals

- Standardize and streamline the incident response process  
- Provide actionable steps for Tier 1 through Tier 3 analysts  
- Reduce response time and improve documentation quality  
- Support handoffs between detection engineering, SOC, and IR teams  
- Promote knowledge sharing and upskilling within the team

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tools & Frameworks Used

These playbooks may reference or include commands and workflows for:

- **SIEM queries (e.g., Exabeam, Splunk, Sentinel)**
- **EDR tools (e.g., CrowdStrike, Defender for Endpoint)**
- **PowerShell & Python scripts**
- **MITRE ATT&CK Framework**
- **KAPE, SQLECmd, Search-UnifiedAuditLog, and more**
